"""Service layer for admin operations.

Note: Task management operations have been migrated to the dedicated
tasks feature module. See: example_service.features.tasks.service

For task management, use TaskManagementService:
    from example_service.features.tasks.service import (
        TaskManagementService,
        get_task_service,
    )

from __future__ import annotations

# This module is now minimal as task operations have been migrated.
# Future admin-specific services can be added here.
