## RabbitMQ Configuration File
## This file configures RabbitMQ settings

## Note: Deprecated features have been removed.
## If you need metrics collection, use the management plugin's built-in metrics.
## For queue creation, use standard queue types (durable/exclusive) instead of transient non-exclusive.

## Connection Limits
## Increase connection limits to handle more concurrent connections
connection_max = 1000

## Memory and Disk Limits
## These are set via environment variables in docker-compose.yml
## but can be overridden here if needed

## Logging
## Log level can be set via RABBITMQ_LOG environment variable
## Options: error, warning, info, debug

## Management Plugin
## Management plugin is enabled by default in rabbitmq:4-management-alpine image
## Metrics collection mode: basic (recommended for production)
management.rates_mode = basic
